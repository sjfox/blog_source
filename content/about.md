### Contact Me
I can be reached via [Email](spncrfx@gmail.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/foxandtheflu)

### Research Interests
I'm a PhD student in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) graduate program at the University of Texas at Austin, and am currently advised by [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/).

My work focuses primarily on statistical modeling of infectious disease dynamics, and I'm interested in using these models to understand basic biological questions regarding disease spread and intervetions (though I've recently worked on more applied projects with Zika). I'm especially interested in understanding multiple disease interactions on contact networks (*e.g.* influenza subtype competition, HIV/TB amplification, etc.), and have a few planned projects to continue in that realm for the future. 

### Outreach
I'm also interested in attempting to make science, statistics, and programming accessible to others. To that end I co-handle the EEB departmental [twitter](https://twitter.com/ecoevobevo) and [facebook](https://twitter.com/ecoevobevo) accounts with [Tracy Burkhard](https://twitter.com/ttburk), where we've recently began monthly EEB lab profiles to highlight the people in science here at UT; I co-teach the [Introduction to Biological Statistics Course](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/CCBB/Introduction+to+Biological+Statistics+Course), which is a weekly seminar for graduate students to learn programming and statistics in R; and I taught an afternoon workshop at the University library to introduce non-STEM majors to the R programming language.
